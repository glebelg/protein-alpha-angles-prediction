# Protein alpha angles prediction

Predicting the 3D structure of proteins is one of the most important issues in bioinformatics.
Having knowledge about protein conformation, it becomes possible to study the interaction of several proteins and consequently invent new medicines.
With the development of machine learning algorithms, folding prediction has reached a new level, since experimental methods require a lot of time and money.
This work describes application of DL methods to predicting the class of dihedral angles ùõº of a coarse-grained protein model, which can be further used as an initial approximation for constructing the 3D structure of the amino acid sequence.
The achieved results are 0.88 F1-score for the binary classification, 0.79 for the threeclass classification, 0.75 for the four-class classification.
